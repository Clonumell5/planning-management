Below is a simplified example of city planning map code in Python without comments:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

class CityMap:
    def __init__(self, city_name, city_size):
        self.city_name = city_name
        self.city_size = city_size
        self.buildings = []

    def add_building(self, building):
        self.buildings.append(building)

    def show_map(self):
        plt.figure(figsize=(8, 8))
        plt.title(f"City Map of {self.city_name}")
        plt.xlim(0, self.city_size)
        plt.ylim(0, self.city_size)

        for building in self.buildings:
            plt.plot(building[0], building[1], 'ko', markersize=10)  # Plot buildings as black circles

        plt.grid(True)
        plt.xlabel("X Coordinate")
        plt.ylabel("Y Coordinate")
        plt.show()

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    city = CityMap("Metropolis", 100)
    city.add_building((20, 30))
    city.add_building((50, 70))
    city.show_map()
```

In this code:

- `CityMap` class represents a city map with attributes for city name, city size, and a list of buildings.
- The `add_building` method adds a building to the city map.
- The `show_map` method displays the city map using Matplotlib library.
- Example usage demonstrates how to create a city map, add buildings to it, and display the map.

This is a basic example, and you can extend it to include more features such as roads, parks, landmarks, etc., based on your city planning requirements.
